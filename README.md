This is the code used for the experiments in an article discussing the viability of AUC ROC in unbalanced binary classification problems.

The article was published on Medium: [https://medium.com/birds-eye-view-on-the-viability-of-auc-roc-in-unbalanced-binary-classification-problems](https://medium.com/its-tinkoff/birds-eye-view-on-the-viability-of-auc-roc-in-unbalanced-binary-classification-problems-b4dbff7a79ea).

The essential functions are contained within [utils.py](utils.py).

Each of the four experiments in the article has its corresponding `.ipynb` file. The code for models training in the fourth experiment can be found in [04-experiment](04-experiment).
